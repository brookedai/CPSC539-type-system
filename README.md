# CPSC539-type-system

Run with:
```racket
racket main.rkt
```

You can input a program to run it through the type checker (eg. enter `(if true then 1 else 2)` when prompted).

To run tests, uncomment `(test)` at the bottom in `main.rkt`. Test programs are defined in `stages/sltlc-parser.rkt`.

Project report can be found [here](Brooke_Dai_CPSC_539_project_report.pdf).
